revdancatt	“Jettisoning 400 fish no longer spams web requests” - nice to see @EliteDangerous fixing the quirks :)
revdancatt	@tomcoates It’s fun in the way that watching Formula 1 Racing can be fun. A lot of going zooooom, with the odd pit stop thrown in…
revdancatt	@tomcoates …however, with the Oculus Rift it’s utterly amazing.
revdancatt	This #VATMOSS is crazy, I specifically use @stripe for payment so I’m abstracted away from billing address. Step 1&amp;2 https://t.co/TDN7s7gBIq
revdancatt	“For confidentiality the payment service provider can remove house number &amp; street name from the billing address” - I’ll make a pull request
revdancatt	Published 10th December 2014 - “On 1 January 2015 the VAT rules for cross-border B2C supplies of ‘digital services’ will change”…
revdancatt	Geee, thanks for the heads-up so I can just re-write these various sites over Christmas to take account of new tricky bookkeeping. #VATMOSS
revdancatt	lol #VATMOSS “You are now in charge of keeping customer data” … “btw, you’re now also dealing with Data Protection act ‘cause you keep data”
revdancatt	#VATMOSS “What’s that, you sold “Deep Dungeon Delve of Doom” PDF for £3.99? Now you need to keep customer data stored for 10 years” - nice.
revdancatt	@tharsheblows That’s the crazy part, I’ve lost mp3 files from 7 years ago. Back to printing out paper 7 keeping it in boxes.
revdancatt	@rachelandrew ooh, that’s super handy. Thank you for doing this.
revdancatt	RT @rachelandrew: @revdancatt I have a bunch of stuff here that I am adding to http://t.co/X7kTOmh0aS
revdancatt	#VATMOSS oh wait, this is easy. If “I have read the T&amp;C” check-boxes and EULAs work, I simple “I am not a EU resident, promise” should work.
revdancatt	…then just refuse to sell digital products to anyone in the EU. That keeps things nice and simple. Surely that must be the intended outcome.
revdancatt	@dominik I can kind of understand why it’s happening… but the lack of understanding of digital is astonishing.
revdancatt	@KateDrawsComics @jaggeree @abbyryder  Well, that’s super handy of them :/ On the plus side I now have some Widdershins E-Books to read :D
revdancatt	it’s @hackcircus #5! Best bitcoins purchase so far. Solar energy -&gt; bit coin miner -&gt; magazine subscription. http://t.co/RCFfLohX6s
revdancatt	Sadly turning the sun’s energy into magazine subscriptions is less practical now bitcoin mining difficulty has increased.
revdancatt	On the plus side all that HMRC #VATMOSS information has a nice font… so there is that.
revdancatt	Constantly amazed at the screenshots @catherinebuca composes in game http://t.co/Cig6kc9iqe (&amp; mod handling ability). http://t.co/govebsPc10
revdancatt	@catherinebuca yeah, but… you have the photographer’s eye, they are quiet beautiful. Stunned at modern game graphics (with low fps I assume)
revdancatt	@catherinebuca I always expected that you had to turn the gtx setting all the way up for the screen shot &amp; sacrifice fps in the process.
revdancatt	@catherinebuca …and then turn the settings back down to actually play :)
revdancatt	Oh my @EliteDangerous with the @oculus rift is just so beautiful I think I cried just a little bit. The future is going to be amazing.
revdancatt	@tomstuart well if you’re ever in the area, you’re more than welcome. Cost/Tech isn’t there yet, 5yrs time will be amazing.
revdancatt	@tomstuart v.interesting watching Isobel (6) experience it though, her ability to context switch virtual experiences is unnerving.
revdancatt	Should probably make an attempt to encourage the children to go to bed. *starts just one more trade run in Elite*

revdancatt	@chthonicionic @VirginTrains They may not have thought this through.
revdancatt	@hackcircus Ooh, didn’t realise that @mh_clough was Shrewsbury based, that’s handy. I would have come, but was already destined for London.
revdancatt	Never underestimate the reduction in stress from knowing you can fall asleep &amp; still end up at home /cc @VirginTrains http://t.co/4ytDOwohPV
revdancatt	Of course, food helps too. All they need now are blankets and I may begin to enjoy the whole coming to London thing. http://t.co/yxxi8Fdzof
revdancatt	@waferbaby its a couple times a month thing that starts at 5am and finishes at 11pm. This is a new direct train, makes a world of difference

revdancatt	Homeschooling update; kids super happy, chilled, no tests/SATs to cram for next year. Using t’internet to self educate about all sorts.
revdancatt	Kinda easy… if you can get over the angst &amp; worry that you’re doing the right thing.
revdancatt	@markwallace intense sessions teaching them about how to use youtube &amp; internet safely. Then let them get on with it + gentle guiding.
revdancatt	@markwallace imagine you had 2 weeks, 9 to 5(+) no interruptions to learn a skill to a basic level with the whole internet as a resource.
revdancatt	@KirstyBurgoine Amy the Doctor’s companion was also in that Pompeii episode.

revdancatt	@blech @mildlydiverting @radioroundabout I ran out of C60s, so I’m taping it over old @shiftrunstop stop episodes.
revdancatt	@mildlydiverting @blech @radioroundabout @shiftrunstop no way! I liked the bit with the owls!
revdancatt	@radioroundabout 👯
revdancatt	Was looking for a horror style film for children ie something that seemed scary but isn’t. Found “Down to the Cellar” http://t.co/CB5HSLXpBL
revdancatt	Difficult genre to find, Horror for Children, most tend towards camp or comedy. But straight not bloody/gore scary for kids, not a thing.
revdancatt	This because the kids desperately wanted to watch a “scary movie” but you know, at the same time they’re kids.
revdancatt	@sdp to be honest, I think it’s just that one. The others are probably a bit much.
revdancatt	@sdp lol :)
revdancatt	@garrettc oooh, that’s a good one. We’re still after the horror film aesthetic but without nightmare fuel. That may do it.
revdancatt	@sdp I’ll have to go and look now, this is good. Otherwise I was thinking old B&amp;W classic wolf man type films.
revdancatt	@wesayso of course, that sounds near perfect, ty totally forgotten about that.
revdancatt	@sdp each time someone references a horror film the kids are all “we want to see, we want to see” so something horror-esk, so hard to find.
revdancatt	@megpickard @wesayso I love the film, but yes may be a bit long and drawn out for them. I want to watch it again now :)
revdancatt	@stefangoodchild that looks like fun. I think I’m trying for the 70s aesthetic of horror films, but without the actual terror part. Tricky.
revdancatt	@wesayso @megpickard yeah, that’s falling into camp. I guess it’s a kind of impossible thing I’m after…
revdancatt	@wesayso @megpickard …they do comedy films for kids, action films for kids, scary films for kids, not horror films for kids (understandably)
revdancatt	@wesayso @megpickard that’s was Down to the Cellar was sort of about, stop motion = oh, we can do that, and…
revdancatt	@wesayso @megpickard …the stop motion also kind of signalled that the film was obviously not real, so dark/scary but can see how it’s done.
revdancatt	@megpickard @wesayso oh yeah! Coraline’s a good one! *adds to list*
revdancatt	@megpickard @wesayso I’ve not seen that, but I’m guessing a no… along with Little Otik.
revdancatt	@yoz ah, that looks more the ticket. And something for me to watch thru first, this could be a winner!
revdancatt	@waferbaby that’s been sitting on the shelf for a while, to the point it’s reached near mythical status. Not sure we can ever watch it now.
revdancatt	@Alby Monster House is now on the list… this is getting good, feels BH more prepared for spooky movie nights.
revdancatt	@waferbaby is good… veering towards camp category, you know, only slightly :)
revdancatt	@waferbaby lol. I think dancing goblins seals it.
revdancatt	@DeanVipond ooh, never ‘eard of it, will zoom off to imdb and then add to the potential spooky films list.
revdancatt	@DeanVipond just the name sounds scary.
revdancatt	@DeanVipond brilliant!!!! This is much more like it!
revdancatt	@DeanVipond I saw Chockablock but im guessing that’s not the same thing.
revdancatt	@minglis adding to the list :) ty
revdancatt	@hackcircus @DeanVipond excellent, I love the look of the 70/80s stuff. Shame the didn’t make series 3 of Tripods.
revdancatt	@hackcircus @DeanVipond would love that tyvm! I don’t think I’d ever seen so much bubble wrap used as scenery in a tv program before.
revdancatt	@RellyAB @megpickard I think Coraline would be too much for 6yr old. Will try with the others.
revdancatt	@katenash thank you for creating #girlgangtv. Parent hat on, what you’re doing tis v.important as my kids grow up. World needs more you.
revdancatt	Damnit, every time I die in Crossy Road it’s my own bloody fault.

revdancatt	New fav thing, scrolling forever down the “People You May Know” page on LinkedIn until it’s essentially random people… then adding them.
revdancatt	…I’m now connected to 1 Founder, 2 Curators, a Thinker, 1 Fremium Game Design Consultant and a Henchman for well-known Russian oligarch.
revdancatt	2014, the year of not going to conferences and eschewing posting on Medium. Didn’t learn a huge amount of value from that.
revdancatt	So I guess next year I’ll go to conferences and post on Medium and not learn much from doing that either, instead.
revdancatt	I made some riotous &amp; appallingly bad background work music to push thru the infinite jukebox http://t.co/8x5LUNnM8T http://t.co/Zj7UU1FjCr
revdancatt	Starts a tiny bit Sputnik then rapidly gets much worse, but good for blocking out pretty much all background noise.
revdancatt	Although I think the effect of listening to it for the whole day means I’ve been slightly tense for 8 straight hours. That’s can’t be good.
revdancatt	@hackcircus Tripods arrived today, now looking forward to all 5 hours 23 minutes of excitement. Kids will remember this xmas for sure!
revdancatt	Has technology advanced to the point where Pringles tubes are no longer needed at hacker meets? Asking for a friend.

revdancatt	Turns out, the kids are now big fans of Gremlins. http://t.co/7RTZMyth5G

revdancatt	If only I wasn’t so busy, maybe next time: RT “@arusbridger: Advertisement for next Editor in Chief of the Guardian http://t.co/u9dmgS3pXW”

revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal I’m guessing it falls into the “or what”. I fave some to review at an undetermined future point…
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal I thought it was part of the “slash so confused” series of thoughts when I pressed fave.
revdancatt	@infovore seems like a generally good outlook on life.
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal look back thru Aaron’s stream for “/ so confused” they look like notes to a future self…
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal as in people use Twitter in different ways, some broadcast, some are personal notes…
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal …individually I don’t think it makes much sense, but who knows together, in the future, they may.
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal …to not answer your question, I like to fave the ones that include someone I know.
revdancatt	@tomcoates @hondanhon @aaronofmontreal honestly they look like mental notes trackable back to a person…

fakekatiehorner	@The_D_Rules I like the way you think. The D doth rule. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	http://twitpic.com/1f3a3h - I couldn't have said it better if I had written it myself. I didn't write it though. Srsly. ;-)

fakekatiehorner	I had the best dream last night. It played out exactly like this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu-GDrrUTxo
fakekatiehorner	Dude, I'm getting a Dell. But which one should I have at my control? What do you guys think? http://is.gd/bDCpZ
fakekatiehorner	@arogersphotos You know if I could I would. Always. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	I'M TRENDING!!!...or at least "Shameless Self-Promoter" is.
fakekatiehorner	Will this weekend be the one to pop this spring's tornado cherry? Stayed tuned to ME to find out if you are going to die.
fakekatiehorner	Kissing my ass won't save you from flying tornado debris, but watching me on TV might. I'm looking at you @markvanbaale and @trustthedust.
fakekatiehorner	Weren't the real meteorologists forecasting storms for late afternoon? My "peers" are pissing me off. Don't get @fakekatiehorner's hopes up.
fakekatiehorner	I've been doing a little freelancing over at The Onion. http://twitpic.com/1inn6m
fakekatiehorner	Ladies, leave those skirts at home. KC is under a wind advisory today. 30-175 mph winds. Opt instead for the always fashionable pant suit.
fakekatiehorner	.@angelchrys @roogie The better question would be, why am I not on your TV always? @fakekatiehorner needs her some more air time. Pronto.
fakekatiehorner	Tornado is derived from the Spanish word for thunderstorm (Tornada). ¿dónde está el tornada mortal? Happy Cinco de Mayo everybody.
fakekatiehorner	Hailey the weather ferret is ready to celebrate. How much tequila can you give a ferret? http://twitpic.com/1l99e3
fakekatiehorner	@KCWeather Does LRC Weather have the ability to produce weather? If so, I think I have a few suggestions for you. ;-)
fakekatiehorner	The answer is 3. 4 shots of tequila is apparently too much for a ferret. http://twitpic.com/1la7uc
fakekatiehorner	I'm beginning to loath the taunting sounds of monthly tornado siren tests. I NEED the real thing.
fakekatiehorner	.@nkcphotog She's not dead. In fact, she just had a puke rally. I cut her off of tequila though. She's drinking cerveza now.
fakekatiehorner	.@forensicsfreak9 Hey, you can't be accurate with both the weather and Spanish translations. I'll stick to what I know. Pant suits.
fakekatiehorner	RT @gary_doyle: @fakekatiehorner Can't wait to see you soon at B&N with your new book "Using weather to scare the crap out of your http: ...
fakekatiehorner	Come visit me at Barnes & Noble. http://is.gd/bXan8 You'll probably want to pick this book up for your kids as well. http://is.gd/bXaf3
fakekatiehorner	.@manningtheship Warned? I do the warning around here. I also do the IfYouDontThinkThisStormWillKillYouThinkAgain-ing around here.
fakekatiehorner	I did a little switcheroo on Hailey the weather ferret last night. No more alcohol for her after what happened Wed http://twitpic.com/1lrmzc
fakekatiehorner	.@vivid13 O'Douls = not cleaning up ferret puke, which is better for me. She looks tired because she's high.
fakekatiehorner	Like me, these guys know when dangerous conditions are near. #FF @VitalAlert @PaulRevere @B9Robot @sterling_archer @kennyloggins
fakekatiehorner	Sounds like a good enough reason to me. RT @ j007 Crapola. I left my umbrella in the truck. Bring on the tornadoes!
fakekatiehorner	OOOOOOklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain. Sooooooo jealous. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	I just drank 6 cans of Red Bull to prepare for tonight. Who's more likely to have a heart attack, me or the old people I scare?
fakekatiehorner	Flooding? Srsly? That's all we're going to get? I'm not even going to sugarcoat this, guys. Worst. Stormtease. Ever. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Can you guys hear the pitter pat of my heart? I know it sounds like thunder, but trust me, that's my heart beat.
fakekatiehorner	OK, that one was thunder. I don't want anybody to think that my heart assploded. I'll still be on TV. ALL NIGHT LONG. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	I'm forecasting three separate storms moving through the metro tonight. Now that's my idea of a threesome. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Just told Hailey that if we don't get some severe weather soon I'm going to go into a deep state of depression. http://twitpic.com/1r8h93
fakekatiehorner	Hail in OP? Not enough to tweet about, people. An appropriate use of that word in a tweet would be "All hail @fakekatiehorner." #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	.@Ericbobmyers I've got a major beef with @Jesus_M_Christ. I pray to him every night for severe weather and he hasn't been listening lately.
fakekatiehorner	@wendycarmen Armageddon. Maybe.
fakekatiehorner	Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen. Tonight we'll put all other things aside. I'm so excited. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	.@Adam_KC @average_jane Thanks. That means a lot. I appreciate that in a "I hope your roofs don't get blown off" kinda way.
fakekatiehorner	@average_jane You know I will.
fakekatiehorner	Hail in Bourbon County? Sounds like a recipe for delicious drunkenness. #KCStorms
fakekatiehorner	Thanks for the #FF, @fakenedyost. You provide a nice transition on the news. I report high winds. Michael reports your team being blown out.
fakekatiehorner	I've taught Hailey the weather ferret well. She is always prepared. http://twitpic.com/1wqx9o
fakekatiehorner	To all of you in SoJoCo. Due to possible flooding, leave luxury import sedan in garage. Drive luxury import SUV instead.
fakekatiehorner	Do you know how difficult it is to put sunscreen on a ferret? http://twitpic.com/1z1or8
fakekatiehorner	Not everyone can escape the heat like Hailey and I. Spray the elderly with a hose or dump a bucket of water on them. You could save a life.
fakekatiehorner	I always know that a storm is a brewin' when I start feeling tightness in my ego. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Should I get the fitted T-shirt or the sweatshirt? http://is.gd/d2kZn
fakekatiehorner	There is a heat advisory for the metro area tomorrow. Woo Hoo! Flip Flops and Tube Tops!
fakekatiehorner	HAILlelujah!!! RT @nick4127 1 inch size hail reported near Camden Point in Platte County
fakekatiehorner	Here comes the BOOM! Here comes the BOOM! Here comes the. Ya'll don't really want it now. BOOM! #kcstorms

fakekatiehorner	There's a cream for that. RT @NobleRot Warning to the Ladies: The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning…in my pants.
fakekatiehorner	It's Tornado Tuesday. Order two tornadoes and the third one is free. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	.@markvanbaale That's right, I'm on a boat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU
fakekatiehorner	Even Hailey the weather ferret is getting into the cupcake fad. http://twitpic.com/297jr3
fakekatiehorner	Sadly, there was no for sale sign. Probably for the best. I would hate to put a dent in my pantsuit budget. http://twitpic.com/2c3v4f
fakekatiehorner	Of all the people on twitter that walk their dog by the "White Tornado" truck, I think @mellinger might be the funniest.

fakekatiehorner	Don't worry Chiefs fans, I will be giving you game updates during my wall-to-wall storm coverage tonight. #kcstorms #kcchiefs
fakekatiehorner	I'm so happy the storm broke up and you all can watch the #Chiefs game without interruption. So happy. Seriously. #damnit
fakekatiehorner	I've just issued a tornado watch for my personal viewing area, because I REALLY want to watch a tornado. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	@worleygirl You're welcome.
fakekatiehorner	@mellinger Oh Sam, I think you know the answer to that. Halftime tornado.
fakekatiehorner	.@fakenedyost Nice win today, and by win I mean the attendance bump you got due to the Chiefs game.
fakekatiehorner	.@mickshaffer I've told you this a dozen times. There is absolutely no proof that we are related. Stop riding my coattails.
fakekatiehorner	.@EdRoberts That's why I bought Hailey the weather ferret one of these. http://twitpic.com/2o8c4r
fakekatiehorner	Raindrops keep fallin' on my head, but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Cryin's not for me. Touchdown #kcchiefs #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Rejoice and yell HAILlelujah. RT @manningtheship Ummm channel 5 just described the hail as hen egg size? Wtf am I supposed to do with that?
fakekatiehorner	Hailey has been ignoring me. She doesn't even watch my forecasts anymore. I need to find out what is troubling her http://twitpic.com/2vomnk
fakekatiehorner	WANT! #boumanswifesdenimjacket
fakekatiehorner	Missing all those tornadoes yesterday had me bummed, so Hailey decided to cheer me up with her cuteness. http://twitpic.com/31dhxt
fakekatiehorner	I've decided to use Twitter as my only resource for weather reporting. Today we'll have 100% chance of snow and 0% chance of Leslie Nielsen.
fakekatiehorner	Is there any other way to report things? RT @NobleRot FYI... The reports of snow this morning are highly exaggerated.
fakekatiehorner	Gah! I wish we had a dome. http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/12/heavy-snow-collapses-metrodome-roof/?hpt=T2
fakekatiehorner	Hailey the weather ferret is bummed there isn't enough snow to ski on. She's calling it a freezing teasing. http://twitpic.com/3fcc2h
fakekatiehorner	My Christmas forecast is white. So if your children are disappointed Christmas morning it's probably your fault, not mine.
fakekatiehorner	@manningtheship Hey, that's my job. Damn you, Busby.

fakekatiehorner	.@wellhellchell As much as I would enjoy the bowing and worshiping, I enjoy inciting fear much more. #LetItSnow #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Some have asked how I determine how much snow will fall. I use a method called forecasting estimated accumulation research. FEAR for short.

fakekatiehorner	The weather is going to be glorious today. There will be no terrestrial reason that you should miss any part of the KU game on TV tonight.

fakekatiehorner	.@fakenedyost Hope you haven’t forgotten that bet we made. Lose today, and you’ll be wearing a powder blue pant suit in the dugout tomorrow.
fakekatiehorner	I got Hailey the weather ferret one year ago today. We had a huge party last night to celebrate. http://twitpic.com/4fpb6m
fakekatiehorner	I think @fakenedyost can afford this on his salary. Pay up, Skipper. http://www.polyvore.com/powder_blue_pants_suit/thing?id=6661459
fakekatiehorner	We already did. @mickshaffer is our son. RT @mikeloving67 I think @fakekatiehorner and @fakenedyost would make beautiful babies together.

fakekatiehorner	Looks like ima have a good weekend. #kcstorms #HAILlelujah
fakekatiehorner	&lt;--- Tornado Aficionado
fakekatiehorner	Canned ham sized hail around some parts of the metro. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	@fakenedyost The @KCStar must have tweaked my forecast. I would never use the word "light". Man up and grow a pair, Skip.
fakekatiehorner	Thunderstorm Schmunderstorm. I'm going off the air until this thing decides to drop some grapefruit sized hail or funnels. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	@blogkc Oh William, I think you know where I'll be on nights like tonight. Basking in unwarranted attention.
fakekatiehorner	Hailey and I will not be celebrating Cinco De Mayo like last year. It still smells like ferret puke in the guest bedroom http://is.gd/6EoOG9
fakekatiehorner	First Wed. of the month. You know what that means? I stand in front of a mirror and test my ability to scare viewers. #thisisonlyatest
fakekatiehorner	.@fakenedyost Not likely. This is a designer pantsuits. Plus, Mike Thompson has a restraining order against me.
fakekatiehorner	I'm going to a Kentucky Derby watch party and this is the only hat I have. I need suggestions for a new one. http://twitpic.com/4u4kqa

fakekatiehorner	Have you guys heard? It's going to be a hot one tomorrow. Pants will be optional. #nopantssuit #pantsfreekc
fakekatiehorner	In the weather industry, we call it "Low Pressure Zoning". RT @gavinesq @fakekatiehorner Do you ever "go commando" on really hot days?
fakekatiehorner	The National Weather Service has just issued a Fromunda Warning in KC for the next 24 hours. #kcheatwave #cheese
fakekatiehorner	We didn't set a record high today, but I did. #puffpuffgive
fakekatiehorner	.@TrustTheDust Do you think I would own a ferret and not hot box it?
fakekatiehorner	The National Weather Service has extended the Fromunda Warning to include all people in the metro, not just the fat ones.
fakekatiehorner	Is it galoshes or goulashes? I always confuse the two. You should probably have both with you today just in case. #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	Let's do this. #5hourenergy #kcstorms
fakekatiehorner	#kcstorms RT @manningtheship I can forecast with complete confidence that at least one Pommie is getting punched before this storm ends.
fakekatiehorner	RT @DrunkToddHaley: I am loving how Hosmer's Homer brought in a thunderstorm #Royals
fakekatiehorner	Fixed that for you. RT @Viper6Ancient Horner allows the earth to revolve around the sun and not herself. #Hornerfacts not #Hosmerfacts
fakekatiehorner	@Alisha_Beth I'm sure the rest of the presentation centered around me notifying the masses of impending doom.
fakekatiehorner	LIES!!!! RT @BottomLineCom Katie Horner's day's numbered at KCTV. http://ow.ly/4TOim
fakekatiehorner	Just spent some time brushing up my resume. I need a little help. Is it mongering or mongoring?
fakekatiehorner	Don’t worry about me, I’ll just take my forecasts online -- @edroberts style. Is @KCWeatherYoullBeAliveInTheMorning available?
fakekatiehorner	Wouldn’t you know it, on the same day I get 1000 followers I find out I’m getting canned. #friday13th
fakekatiehorner	Screw it! Somebody send the web guy out to get some vodka. Let’s get drunk in front of the green screen.
fakekatiehorner	.@pitchplog @TheKCRag @bottomlinecom Don't worry, I'll DM you guys if there is hail or tornadoes or a single snow flake within 300 miles.
fakekatiehorner	Was just told that it's not appropriate to ride camera 2 like a bull. Boooo! Ima go have some fun with the teleprompter now. #drinkingatwork
fakekatiehorner	So, Friday wasn’t my last day. It’s more of a “transition” period. Wish I would have known that before I top shelved all the toilets.
fakekatiehorner	@fakenedyost It's called an Upper Decker when I'm out at Kauffman Stadium.
fakekatiehorner	The menacing dark clouds befallen on the metro are not a precursor of the impending rapture, probably. #kcstorms

fakekatiehorner	#FF @kkwhb Kevin, your arrogance is admirable.
fakekatiehorner	.@TonysKansasCity You want to take me out on a date? I do like a man that doesn't mind going down to the basement when told to.
fakekatiehorner	If you don't have AC, stand beneath an overpass on a busy interstate. It's shady and the traffic provides a nice steady breeze. #BeatTheHeat
fakekatiehorner	Does that apply to pant suits? #PantsFreeKC RT @artofbeingblunt Today is too damn hot. I'm declaring a "Pants Optional" advisory.
fakekatiehorner	.@inkkcmag Bail? That's what this city is going to have to do when these flood waters rise, and guess who won't be here to warn you.
fakekatiehorner	I'm going to enjoy this "time off". Hailey the weather ferret and I are already planning a nice vacation to some place violently weathery.
fakekatiehorner	I'm stepping down in September. What are the odds that @FakeNedYost has to turn in his jock strap before I turn in my pant suit?
fakekatiehorner	I keep getting reprimanded for cranking the AC way down. I'm leaving in a few months, I don't care about the electric bill. It's balls hot.
fakekatiehorner	I almost feel sorry for you, KC. Just when you thought you were getting rid of the biggest media whore around, along comes @WildBillStanton.
fakekatiehorner	Since I can't report on the weather anymore I'm just going to tweet quotes from the movie Twister.
fakekatiehorner	He's gonna rue the day he came up against The Extreme, baby. Bill, I'm talkin' imminent rueage. #TwisterQuotes
fakekatiehorner	Because Bill *is* the extreme. There was one time, he has a bottle of Jack Daniels, he was butt naked. #TwisterQuotes
fakekatiehorner	He walks up to the twister, he throws the bottle, he says here have some. The bottle never hits the ground. #TwisterQuotes
fakekatiehorner	In a severe lightning storm, you wanna grab your ankles and stick your butt in the air. #TwisterQuotes
fakekatiehorner	Unfuckingbelievable! I'm off the air less than one week and there is an earthquake in the area? An earthquake?!?!?! FML
fakekatiehorner	So, do you guys still believe that I can't control the weather? If I can't report it, it doesn't happen.

KrispyDingo	@Mikeazariah If I'm a figment of @webspaceships's imagination, he needs to imagine me some better shit.
KrispyDingo	RT @PoeticStanziel: @midi2304 @erlendur CCP should have convinced NKotB to reunite, one night only in Reykjavik.
KrispyDingo	@whistlerbean No space dicks? WTF?
KrispyDingo	RT @SindelPellion: @bagehi left his hat, scarf and phone in the UI roundtable. Spread the word: 100 mil reward for their safe return. #twee…
KrispyDingo	Didn't I say we should have something like this here on Twitter a few months ago? Yup, sure did.  http://t.co/xDqSKwBIp2
KrispyDingo	Patch Notes for Odyssey (via @Pocket) #longreads | Thems some seriously long patch notes for tomorrow.  http://t.co/wZS9BztBfk
KrispyDingo	@RixxJavix Now that Odyssey has landed, that means no more open recruitment for Stay Frosty, right? So, what are reqs now?
KrispyDingo	I’m sure you’ve gets have all seen it already, but jumping through a stargate, woah.
KrispyDingo	@AdainyG No, more like this https://t.co/EBjjPVUZwz
KrispyDingo	@RixxJavix Saw that when I joined the EVEOGANDA channel. Thanks.
KrispyDingo	@RixxJavix The other half.
KrispyDingo	@RixxJavix Exactly
KrispyDingo	"Alliance Tournament XI Tournament prize ships and more!" Thems some nice ships.  http://t.co/YHeY5fJaAc
KrispyDingo	Seriously, @EveOnline, you won’t let me paste my password in the new Mac Launcher? I can’t remember that damn thing!
KrispyDingo	@salhany I’ll have to do that, then. Thanks.
KrispyDingo	Decided to call it a day at the customer's and I'm heading home.
KrispyDingo	Hello Marietta.
KrispyDingo	Of course, I see @bagehi’s tweet about an Xbox twitch app(awesomesauce) while #ATXI is on break…
At least we have Jita cam.
KrispyDingo	I kinda wanna see this reverse TiDi thing. If I’ve missed it from an earlier match, don’t tell me or I’ll cry.
KrispyDingo	@MaxUrsa NNNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! :'(
KrispyDingo	@ThatEveGuy Thank you, sir. @MaxUrsa, you suck :P
KrispyDingo	Tried to redeem my @EveOnline Second Decade Collector’s Set promo code today, and I was told it had already been used. Very annoyed.
KrispyDingo	@SindelPellion are you having any overscan issues with the twitch app on Xbox?
KrispyDingo	Obsidian Front vs. The Initiative, that was awesome. Best match I’ve seen all day. #ATXI
KrispyDingo	So glad we could make it to the 70s and ABBA for Jita cam! #ATXI
KrispyDingo	WOO! BeeGees! #ATXI
KrispyDingo	That providence, with the fireworks, and the disco, beautiful #JitaCam
KrispyDingo	EVE Down under? They should call it EVE Bruce.
KrispyDingo	@squeakyneb unfortunately, I lerned I can’t adjust overscan on my tv from hooking up a pc with an NVIDIA video card.
KrispyDingo	Damn, another great match from The Initiative! #atxi
KrispyDingo	@webspaceships Happy birthday, sir!
KrispyDingo	Yea, twitch.tv works in the browser on the new surround sound system! Now, start the damn #ATXI stream already!
KrispyDingo	RT @Freebooted: .@rickspies looks like how @theMittani will look when he's all grown up. ;)
KrispyDingo	Stupid browser on the surround sound was being all stuttery with the twitch stream. Switched to the Air hooked up to the tv.
KrispyDingo	The jackets seriously make me think they went to a fine restaurant and forgot to bring their own. #ATXI #tweetfleet
KrispyDingo	@webspaceships Not dying.
KrispyDingo	Times up, fellas. M.I.F. won, surprisingly, like 30s before the Navy Domi started going down. #ATXI
KrispyDingo	Ahh, the echo!!! #atxi
KrispyDingo	The Initiative has had 2 damn good matches; really excited to see them agains RvB, but RvB will destroy them!
KrispyDingo	SUNDAY (day) (day) (day) ALLIANCE (nce) (nce) (nce) TOURNAMENT (ment) (ment) (ment) ELEVEN (ven) (ven) (ven)
KrispyDingo	Excellent match, sad to see RvB lost, but a good start to today’s fights. #ATXI
KrispyDingo	@PenelopeStarEOL I was standing about 2 feet away from a 50 inch television during the entire match, yelling. Not sure why it didn’t help.
KrispyDingo	Agony, here’s your ass. 

Love, PL
#ATXI
KrispyDingo	@dianalynnETC I don’t, I think having not @TheMittani working for @CCPGames might confuse people. 
@rickspies
KrispyDingo	Who is this Michael Bolton character @ShadooEVE keeps referring to? I see @CCPDolan.
KrispyDingo	For the Razer joke, @ktouborg http://t.co/qXRjjHqy93
KrispyDingo	Requiring a SSD for your triage pilots? Just proof that Internet spaceships are serious business. #eveonline
KrispyDingo	@whistlerbean But you could spend the whole game yelling, "THIS IS SPARTA!" At your monitor!
KrispyDingo	@vincentpeters I saw a game years ago where the player said his primary school. It was pretty funny.
KrispyDingo	EFT on my Mac with Winebottler http://t.co/qd4o19lsEh
KrispyDingo	Versus EFT on my Mac with Wineskin Winery. http://t.co/sUGE6DlJiR
KrispyDingo	If only I could get EVEMon running again, but with poor support of .NET 4 in Wine, not happening.
KrispyDingo	@TiberiusStarGaz They’re totally free. Winebottler http://t.co/6qU4bQW5NT
Wineskin Winery http://t.co/I7va7h9oM7
KrispyDingo	Why is uploading so damn slow? Hurry up, internets, it’s only a 100MB file!
KrispyDingo	Did you know I’m a nice guy? Really it’s true, stop laughing. Here, have an EFT.app with Wineskin Winery for your Mac
http://t.co/ZjDLeofBda
KrispyDingo	@webspaceships Why does all the cool stuff have to happen on weekends when I have my kids?
KrispyDingo	@PudTugger you get these 2 guys and they EVE at each other and whoever EVEs the hardest, wins.
KrispyDingo	Fuck, the stream about the winter expansion, I forgot, fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck fuck.
KrispyDingo	I think I've finally lost it. I'm having a conversation with the dog and doing both his part and mine aloud.
KrispyDingo	@ReesNoturana I guess nothing? Maybe? I have to socially interact with someone at work, right?
KrispyDingo	It’s a box! What could it be? http://t.co/RDEqG6WiyB
KrispyDingo	Let’s open it and see! http://t.co/PkQrtbRuFx
KrispyDingo	Ohh, didn’t see that sticker at first… http://t.co/pIYy3cFIkA
KrispyDingo	Wouldja look at that! http://t.co/dGCRxr1QDV
KrispyDingo	I’m not sure how I feel about this Danger Game with @CCP_Guard’s face on it. And who is dressed as the woman? http://t.co/SA8jPWBwkE
KrispyDingo	Rifter USB hub looks pretty cool, but that cable they give you is like 1 foot long. http://t.co/sFdPCvABIv
KrispyDingo	Updated the EFT in Wineskin Winery app to version 2.20.3. Share and enjoy. http://t.co/GAmdd74Tdj
KrispyDingo	I need to find a corp that isn’t just me and a couple other characters that are also me.
KrispyDingo	@Kinis_Deren I’m 'Murican, so no on the AU TZ. I’ve been thinking about Stay Frosty for a while.
KrispyDingo	@Drpoomgames I’ve been in mission running corps, null sec, worm holes. Never been a pirate though.
KrispyDingo	@EzeriaMistanta @Kinis_Deren I’ve gotten that before. I wanted this, but it was taken. :( http://t.co/3YqhLkYys9
KrispyDingo	@Kinis_Deren Plus there is the awesomeness that is @RixxJavix
KrispyDingo	Launched Vitality from Steam, and it let me use the Overlay! Kind of… http://t.co/UTqQruHbRq
KrispyDingo	RT @TG_3: Guess what's seeded on Sisi. http://t.co/njH5fIC0Ud #Tweetfleet
KrispyDingo	I’m almost to 90mil SP, and just don’t know what to train next, because capital ships, meh, industry, hell no. Guess more skills to V?
KrispyDingo	The only subcap combat ships I can’t fly are the non-Minmatar Tech 2 Battleships. That’s about 3 months of training. Maybe that next?
KrispyDingo	@ChYph3r @phyridean I have an alt totally dedicated to Industry, so no need for that.
KrispyDingo	So pretty http://t.co/yrYweON3Cc
KrispyDingo	EFT 2.21.1 in Wineskin Winery for your Mac uploaded to EVE Files. http://t.co/oXf85mSEEk
KrispyDingo	@CrazyKinux I started reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep again. Does that count? I mean, I first read it over a decade ago.
KrispyDingo	@winterblink @CrazyKinux Neuromancer and Snow Crash are amazing books. I’ve read both multiple times.
KrispyDingo	@Drackarn I was told years ago that you’re better going for a carrier or Rorq because jump freighters are just that expensive. Although…
KrispyDingo	@Drackarn at least a jump freighter can enter high sec through gates. Unlike a carrier or Rorq.
KrispyDingo	Why does EVE in the New Years Eve on the Telly look like the #eveonline  logo?
KrispyDingo	@CCP_Punkturis Not much of a window, I can’t see through it.
KrispyDingo	I love when Kotaku posts about #eveonline. I hate the comments from people who've never played.  http://t.co/gNtxxSHcFZ
KrispyDingo	Apps I have working in Wineskin Winery on my Mac

KrispyDingo	@Kaisur You mean pyfa &gt; EFT?
KrispyDingo	@ktouborg You look more like a Bekah as opposed to a Becca.

KrispyDingo	If you play Elder Scrolls Online, you should totes add me or some junk. Account name is grimmlock.
KrispyDingo	@SindelPellion @EVE_Scatha Hurt too much? GRRM had 15 years to come to terms with the Red Wedding.
KrispyDingo	Oh, I passed 100mil SP. Go me. Didn’t even notice.
KrispyDingo	Selling my iPhone 4S. You should totall buy it!

KrispyDingo	Character name 'Krispy Dingo' was found on plate row 6 and column 1. Line number is 117.

Too bad I can’t really see it.
KrispyDingo	@PoeticStanziel Would have required a new, non-Trial account, since it was character with most skill points on the account.

KrispyDingo	Hanging out with goon cat, again. #tweetfleet http://t.co/UNFJ39nkqg
KrispyDingo	@spanky_ikkala it’s not A goon cat, it’s THE goon cat. Former pet of former CCP Skreegs (DARIUS JOHNSON)

KrispyDingo	@missed well, I didn’t @ you…
communicatrix	@MarilynM What baby?
communicatrix	@mulegirl Wait—*that's* what @Mike_FTW wanted for his birthday? Excuse me while I reorder my entire universe....
communicatrix	Happy birthday to my favorite man—perhaps HUMAN—on the internets, @Mike_FTW!
communicatrix	@1938loren @chartreuseb That show totally reactivated my 1975 crush. Like riding a bicycle.
communicatrix	@chartreuseb And seriously, if this means you have yet to check out The Bird and the Bee, you totally need to get on it.
communicatrix	@kissane STOP. My reading list is already eighteen unruly tentacles longer than I can handle, largely thanks to you!
communicatrix	@Mike_FTW Alas, it is also not Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. 

Love, 
the Chicagoan
communicatrix	@chartreuseb And they live up to it!
communicatrix	@heymarci Yes.
communicatrix	@inthefade Nothing more inspiring than awesome people making room to be even more awesome. Congrats/thanks: the world needs your awesome.
communicatrix	@danielpunkass Yes. Born/raised 8 blocks from Pizzeria Due. Last indulged 4 years ago. Cornmeal crust = the ONLY Chicago pizza.
communicatrix	@danielpunkass Ack! I used to have one—as good as it got, without a pizza oven. But I think I pitched it when I went on the SCD.
communicatrix	@lukemysse Yes! Although at 11am, it's more "blunch," I think.
communicatrix	@lukemysse @DyanaValentine I will require advance notice, so as to snag sufficient rest first. :-)
communicatrix	RT @CastingNetworks: Come to our FREE seminar this Saturday w/ guest speaker Colleen Wainwright! Get your ticket: http://t.co/sBOakcSk5W
communicatrix	@robdelaney @BuzzFeed You had me at "Mother".
communicatrix	@FlashdanceOShea Thanks, Lianne! So glad you enjoyed it.
communicatrix	@mat Holy crap. @alexismadrigal is in my head, only with research/data/exquisite thinking. THANK YOU.
communicatrix	@bonniegillespie Likewise and back atcha, always and forever.
communicatrix	@joshacagan About 1/4" long? Pretty sure that was mine.
communicatrix	@kadietweets Thank you, kindly. I had way more fun than I'd thought I would—and am still paying for it, two years later. :-)
communicatrix	@awalkerinLA 100% dairy-free! I feel really good about this change.
communicatrix	@awalkerinLA Frankly, the best things do. Congratulations!
communicatrix	@Mike_FTW Finally. A reason I'm glad I did NOT go.
communicatrix	@MalloryWood Thank you! This is my preferred combo of things to be, so it's nice to know when I'm hitting it.
communicatrix	@matthewbaldwin They need a Peggy Hill t-shirt.
communicatrix	@seriouspony Clearly, you need to meet @JesseThorn.
communicatrix	Changing your estrogen patch in front of your ex-husband at the coffee shop is the new pooping with the door open.
communicatrix	@robdelaney Pshaw. Who *hasn’t* done it, amirite?
communicatrix	@adbroad Thank you for the kindly words. And @TheGirlPie, thank you for the introduction!
communicatrix	@mulegirl Queen of the leaderboard (and my personal hero—duh!).
communicatrix	I'm not going to bed too early; I'm realizing the immigrant dreams of my forebears.
communicatrix	Every time I hang out in the library, I learn a new way that people can totally creep me out.
communicatrix	@Mikeachim Thank you! And hail, fellow walker, and well-met!
communicatrix	@Modular_ink Ha! Closet ironers out themselves. I need to find the socially equivalent activity and start a club. For when we get lonely.
communicatrix	@folktrash It's the gift that keeps on giving. (And thank you! I celebrate Birthday Month, so it's all good!)
communicatrix	@DaveHamilton That's funny—there's kind of a campfire vibe here, too, only throughout my entire apartment and the city of Los Angeles.
communicatrix	@luckyshirt Recommended with the button. Seed planted to recommend with some of my actual writing. Thanks for your ongoing honesty.
communicatrix	Every night is Drivers’ Ed Video Night at the Mario’s Peruvian parking lot.
communicatrix	@marykarrlit Ditto. But not on or because of it.
communicatrix	@mulegirl Just enough CAKE!!!
communicatrix	@mulegirl Oh, of COURSE @Mike_FTW already said it. Probably while walking 40,000 steps. At his treadmill desk made out of cake.
communicatrix	@d_g_ You picked the exact right day, friend. Thank you, and glad to hear it.
communicatrix	@phillygirl @jimray HOORAAAAAAAAAY! And all of the other exciting words with vowels! Can't wait for you to be parents!
communicatrix	@erikpatterson If we were my uterus pre-surgery, we'd be exposed oranges!
communicatrix	@spencercross And now your unintentional Goodreads updates are looking code-janky, on top of it.
communicatrix	@spencercross Haha. Stoopit robotz.
communicatrix	@jskipper You listened! Thank you! :-)
communicatrix	@TheGirlPie Are you kidding? I live for stuff like this! Made me happier than anything. Hope you dig the (chap)book, too!
communicatrix	@Mike_FTW @kissane I am leaving that browser tab open all day.
communicatrix	@helslevy @bonniegillespie Great piece, @teresajusino, great cause (@WriteGirlLA), great company (all-around). Thanks!
communicatrix	@nostrich DON'T QUIT QUITTING. Not in the methane stage. Not in the suicidal-ideation phase. NEVER. (26 years free of 2+ packs/day.) DON'T.
communicatrix	@ohheygreat Vesper and self-will.
communicatrix	@edcasey You come down here, boyo. I'll kick your ass but good. cc:@ohheygreat
communicatrix	@edcasey (And YES, I was totally replying to @ohheygreat's reply, but THE OFFER STANDS.)
communicatrix	@Mike_FTW That is some good writing there, friend.
communicatrix	@austinkleon Ha! I've done this by accident a million times when I was on fail-o-rama ATT. Using your hack for (reliable) Verizon!
communicatrix	@inthefade And if you decide you do, you're doing it because I can't.
communicatrix	@Mike_FTW That's what the French call "Q.E.D.", right?
communicatrix	@chrisguillebeau No, no: that means you have banked enough calories for TWO tomorrow!
communicatrix	@austinkleon Agreed, agreed, agreed. An exemplar for the utility of a great editor.
communicatrix	@alaindebotton And arms around free-floating ideas that won't quite coalesce (Status Anxiety my favorite example of this).
communicatrix	@matthewbaldwin Or lady. CRULLER.
communicatrix	@chrisguillebeau Were the squirrels throwing them on your head, as they have mine? Guess I'm too easy a target. Good times!
communicatrix	@henrysaurus Painted from Memory. (Eff you, I'm an old.)
communicatrix	@AlamyContent Great pic—thanks!!
communicatrix	@macgenie @UIPopTart @SmileSoftware @macgreg Yaaaaay! Everybody wins!!!
communicatrix	@scottsimpson After two years of this mandatory bullshit, me neither.
communicatrix	@zeldman Pretty sure EWR is what happens when they don’t.
communicatrix	@scottsimpson And the perfect scary costume would be to undo your second shirt button and answer the door as Slutty Scott Simpson.
communicatrix	@spencercross Shit. Do you have to buy a new card, or just pick one up from the bastards?
communicatrix	@kissane Right? Punch to the gut.
communicatrix	@cjereneta If you run, run for the Big W.
communicatrix	@theurbansherpa We should do a co-not-working sometime.
communicatrix	@edcasey I liked the tweet okay, but the star is for your Halloween name, which I effin' LURVE.
communicatrix	@dooce Or have a colonoscopy in the morning, and be making the rest of your 10K to the can and back.
communicatrix	Pretty much all I plan on eating until spring is roasted acorn squash with butter. Or, you know, just butter.
communicatrix	@UIPopTart You look spectacular!! You should ham it up more often. @macgenie @verso @mrmomoko
communicatrix	@macgenie And in our hearts.
communicatrix	If you're not doing anything at 11am, maybe you could watch @WriteGirlLA accept a huge award from @FLOTUS in DC. http://t.co/rHreDu5UtF …

communicatrix	@matthewbaldwin The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.
communicatrix	@matthewbaldwin Also, I think I need to turn off an IFTTT channel.
communicatrix	@austinkleon Love my jeans+navy thermals. But a recent Dress Like a Girl Week was a needed break. All in moderation, moderation inclusive.
communicatrix	@austinkleon Your great review of The Sisters Bros. + $1.99 Kindle price = no-brainer next-read. Thank you!
communicatrix	@monteiro "Smart" doesn't begin to describe @mulegirl.

communicatrix	@inthefade What??! Not if they bring me back to reprise my role(s), it won’t.
communicatrix	@seriouspony Pun excused on account of excessive cuteness.
communicatrix	@monteiro @austinkleon When you do it right (which you both do) and when you've paid into the system (which is part of doing it right).
communicatrix	@austinkleon Easy there, DAD.
communicatrix	@inthefade I used to smoke after a good run. Until I wised up and stopped running.
communicatrix	@bakocowboyct Great to see you! And even better to hear how well your business is doing. Thanks for the update and keep up the good work!
communicatrix	@thebrianahansen @CastingNetworks Thanks for the kind words, Briana! And for the reminder to check my saved Twitter searches more often!

communicatrix	@agossen And you got my good side—thanks!
communicatrix	@WendyBredhold Haha! That would be one nerdy party, boy howdy.
communicatrix	@TaraBethIdaho Not weird! Totally what I was going to say. @elnemcek could be a stunt handwriter, if that was a thing.
communicatrix	@elnemcek Thank you! I like things neat and tidy—like your amazing cursive hand, as we've already established. :-)
communicatrix	@KieraReilly I would, as I am a helpful ham. Unfortunately, there is no "repeat"—each time is its own special snowflake. (PS: Thank you!)
communicatrix	@KieraReilly Why, yes! And then some: http://t.co/vKUuDMiGBz No one leaves #casesmc w/ bad photos, right @perrettiphoto? :-)
communicatrix	@plautmaayan And miles to go before we sleep—you know it, sister.
communicatrix	@vmoreno_93 Thank you! And that was me on too little sleep and not enough coffee in the afternoon. :-)
communicatrix	@KieraReilly Ha! There's a Spanish @comunicatrix—who knew?!

communicatrix	@florenciapp @WendyBredhold Definitely not third, except as stopgap. Second is so weird, it might work as an art project. Whose profile?
communicatrix	@KatieFloyd Aw. It's kind of sweet and endearing, actually.
communicatrix	@macgenie @BTManu If I ever get a tattoo, it will be a photorealistic one of that adorable hand with a "tattoo".
communicatrix	@jessicahische If someone else picked up the tab, it would be a true day of happiness.
communicatrix	@WendyBredhold @florenciapp You're right! It's since been fixed to 1st. (Although I am seriously toying w/ idea of 2nd, because TRIPPY.)

communicatrix	@kissane I blocked several people using this very policy yesterday.
communicatrix	Because in HS, a male teacher called me out for wearing a "distractingly tight" sweater and suffered no repercussions. #YesAllWomen
communicatrix	Because I have been groped, pinched, lifted off the ground against my will and said nothing for fear of reprisal. #YesAllWomen
communicatrix	@mulegirl Totally. Creep.
communicatrix	Because I have given handjobs to get out of giving blowjobs and blowjobs to get out of having sex and I thought this was NORMAL.#YesAllWomen
communicatrix	Because when I was stalked and harassed, I was told to keep a paper trail and not poke the bear.  #YesAllWomen
communicatrix	Because I actually considered not posting anything to #YesAllWomen for fear of poking the bear.
communicatrix	@KaylaCagan AMEN. Thank you for doing this. Jesus. Afraid to *tweet*, for chrissakes.

heyitsnoah	Simple vs Complex as mentioned in English books since 1800 http://t.co/rGUcZmW4Dt http://t.co/gz1P204ba1
heyitsnoah	@therealgraydon if complexity is about the number of connecting parts then I just think we have a lot more stuff and now it's all connected
heyitsnoah	@therealgraydon yeah, definitely one take. Basically all tech is made of other tech. So more tech creates more tech. Plus the internet.
heyitsnoah	@therealgraydon alternative take I've been thinking about, though, is that things are getting more simple as measured by less middlemen.
heyitsnoah	@therealgraydon but ultimately more stuff to manage = more complex. Take brands. 1920 = 10 brands, 1 market. 2015 = 10 brands, 10 markets.
heyitsnoah	@therealgraydon yeah, though you could argue it started taking off with industrial rev. It was just a different order of magnitude.

kfury	@Matsubue Thank god Linux weathered the storm as a top-tier desktop OS!
kfury	@Matsubue True, they didn't win. But Microsoft's goals were achieved. Similarly, Cyanogen's ongoing battle helps MSFT more than victory.
